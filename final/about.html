            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
              Our mission is to provide sanctuary to those who seek adventure, a
              getaway for young couples to bond through shared experience, and a
              retreat for those who need some time away from the daily grind. We
              aim to do this in the most sustainable way possible. We
              incorporate the zen practice of focusing on the breath in all of
              our activities to ensure you are in touch with your body's needs
              and limitations. Our menu is designed to help naturally detox and
              nourish the body. This is meant to be a place where one can come
              to strengthen the mind-body connection and their connection with
              others. Whether you're looking to embrace the adventure through
              one of our many available activities, or just in it for the rest
              and relaxation, our goal is to see you looking lighter by the time
              you check out. We want you to leave feeling rejuvenated and
              knowing that you have a safe haven here at Pacific Trails Resort.

            <h3>Our Team</h3>

              be taken care of every step of the way. We operate as a team who
              treats each other, and our guests, like family. Our team members
              are very approachable, eager to get to know you, and always ready
              to help. So please feel free to approach anyone you see with a
              Pacific Trails Resort Team Member shirt, or contact our front
              desk, and they will be able to assist you with whatever you need
              regarding your stay. Our team leads and tour guides are CPR and
              AED certified, and there will be at least 2 of these certified
              team members on the grounds at all times. So relax and enjoy the
              moment, you're in great hands with us.

            <h3>Wildlife Warning</h3>
            <p>
              We all love seeing the amazing wildlife that inhabits the area
              around Pacific Trails Resort, but there are some animals to watch
              out for while you're out exploring. We will provide to you a full
              list of the common wildlife seen in the area and which plants and
              animals to steer clear of with your welcome packet at check in.
              Our tour guides are very knowledgeable in what to be aware of out
              on the trail to reduce the risk of encountering a dangerous animal
              or come in contact with a poisonous plant. When you sign up for
              our activities, we can schedule you for a safety brief with one of
              our tour guides to inform you on how to prepare for the terrain,
              inclement weather conditions, how not to get lost, and what to do
              if you do encounter a dangerous animal. This safety brief is
              highly recommended to any experience level, whether you're a
              hobbyist or a survivalist, this course has a lot of great
              information to offer. More details provided at booking.

            <h3>Pet Policy</h3>
            <p>
              We are a dog friendly community, and while we love all dogs, we
              have some guidelines for our visitors who want to bring their
              furry friends with them:
            </p>
            <!-- ul>li*5 -->
            <!-- Font Awesome list icon class -->
            <ul class="fa-ul">
              <li>
                <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></span>You
                know your dog better than we do, so we ask that you use your
                discretion on how to prepare your pup for the trip. There will
                be other people and other dogs on the grounds, so please take
                your dog's temperament into consideration when making
                arrangements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></span>Due to
                allergy and noise concerns for our other guests, we have our dog
                friendly section of the grounds with dog friendly yurts, an
                off-leash dog park, and potty stations.

                dogs must be kept on a leash while on the grounds. We have
                posted ares where there are no dogs allowed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></span>Sorry,
                no dogs allowed in the zen gardens or meditation areas for those

              <li>
                <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></span>We
                cannot allow dogs on the guided group hikes, birdwatching tours,
                or in our kayaks.

              <li>
                <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></span>Dogs
                are allowed off-leash on the trail, however, should you decide
                to let your dog roam, you assume all liability and
                responsibility for the actions of your dog, or anything that may
                happen to your dog on the trail.

            <h3>Sustainable Living</h3>
            <p>
              We are a green focused community here at Pacific Trails Resort. We
              only use locally sourced ingredients for our menu, solar and wind
              generated power, and energy efficient materials and appliances to
              help conserve our beautiful land. Throughout our grounds you will
              see bins marked for compost, recycling, and waste. We also provide
              tips on how to conserve resources in our daily lives in your
              welcome packet upon check in. We ask that our guests observe these
              signs and tips while staying with us. Help us take care of the
              land that takes such great care of us.

        <div class="flow">
          <section>
            <h3>Age Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              We want you to feel like family here, but our facilities aren't
              designed for families. Our minimum age requirement is 18+ to stay
              and participate in our activities, but our age requirement to book
              a stay with us is 21+. What this means is that our guests who are
              over the age of 18, but under the age of 21 can stay in their own
              yurt, and participate in our activities unsupervised, but an adult
              who is 21 years or older must be the one to book the stay and must
              be present for the duration of the stay, as this is who will be
              held responsible for the underage guests.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Payments</h3>
            <p>
              A valid credit card must be used to book a stay with us. The name
              on the credit card used must match that on the photo ID of the
              individual who booked the stay. Any extra services or other fees
              accrued during your stay will be charged to this credit card. Not
              to worry, there are no hidden fees and everything will be
              explained to you upon booking and explained in our welcome packet.

            <h3>Cancellations</h3>
            <p>
              Cancellations are free up to 48 hours prior to your check in. If
              you cancel within 48 hours you will be charged a cancellation fee
              of $100. If you cancel within 24 hours of your check in, you will
              be charged half the price of your booked stay.
            </p>
            <h3>Refunds</h3>
            <p>
              All refunds will be handled the moment you cancel. The entirety of
              your purchase will be refunded minus the accrued cancellation fee
              and credit card service fee. If you decide to check out early, you
              will not be charged any extra for early departure, and we will
              initiate a refund for the prorated amount.
